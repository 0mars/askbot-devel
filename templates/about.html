    <p><strong>{{settings.APP_SHORT_NAME}}</strong> is a collaboratively edited question and answer site created with
    <a href="http://osqa.net">OSQA: The Open Source Q&A System</a>.</p>

    <p>Here you can <strong>ask</strong> and <strong>answer</strong> questions, <strong>comment</strong>
    and <strong>vote</strong> for the questions of others and their answers. Both questions and answers
    <strong>can be revised</strong> and improved. Questions can be <strong>tagged</strong> with
    the relevant keywords to simplify future access and organize the accumulated material.</p>

    <p>This OSQA site is moderated by its members, hopefully - including yourself!
    Moderation rights are gradually assigned to the site users based on the accumulated <strong>"reputation"</strong>
    points. These points are added to the users account when others vote for his/her questions or answers.
    These points (very) roughly reflect the level of trust of the community.</p>

    <p>No points are necessary to ask or answer the questions - so please - <strong><a href="{% url user_signin %}">join
    us!</a></strong></p>

    <p>If you would like to find out more about this site - please see <strong><a href="{% url faq %}">frequently
    asked questions</a></strong>.</p>
