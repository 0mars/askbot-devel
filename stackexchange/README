this app's function will be to:

* install it's own tables    <--- done 
* read SE xml dump into DjangoDB  <--- done
* populate osqa database
* remove SE tables

So far models are automatically created via:

1) add 'stackexchange' to the list of installed apps
2) run: 

    #in-place removal of xml namspace prefix to make parsing easier
    perl -pi -w -e 's/xs://g' $SE_DUMP_PATH/xsd/*.xsd 

    cd stackexchange
    python parse_models.py $SE_DUMP_PATH/xsd/*.xsd > models.py
    cd ..
    python manage.py syncdb

3) unzip SE dump into dump_dir (any directory name)
   you may want to make sure that your dump directory in .gitignore file
   so that you don't publish it by mistake

3) run:

    python manage.py load_stackexchange dump_dir

    does not yet populate final data
