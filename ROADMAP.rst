This document is a map for our activities down the road - therefore ROADMAP.
ROADMAP does not specify deadlines - those belong to the PENDING file

Intro
=========
ROADMAP aims to streamline activities of the OSQA open source project and
to minimize ad-hoc approaches of "big-picture" level.

With one exception: under extreme time pressure improvised approaches are acceptable.

Items in this document must be discussed in public via dev@osqa.net
