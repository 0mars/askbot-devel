this directory contains available skins

1) default - default skin with templates
2) common - this directory is to media directory common to all or many templates

to create a new skin just create another directory under skins/
and start populating it with templates named the same way as in 
default/templates

all paths must be the same except they will be under
yourtemplate/templates

media does not have to be composed of files named the same way as in default skin
whatever media you link to from your templates - will be in operation

templates are resolved in the following way:
* check in skin named as in settings.OSQA_DEFAULT_SKIN
* then skin named 'default'

media is resolved with one extra option
* settings.OSQA_DEFAULT_SKIN
* 'default'
* 'common'
