This branch contains first experimental run on skinning

To create a new skin (say 'myskin') add new directory to forum/skins
and set OSQA_SKIN='myskin'

Your skin does not need to have all the files that 'default' skin has - at once.
It is possible to start customizing OSQA gradually - file-by-file.

Resources are resolved in this order:
templates: yourskin --> default
media (css and scripts): yourskin --> default --> common
