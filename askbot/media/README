#Installation
In order to install foundation with bower and easily work with scss files, you need to install npm and then run locally:

~~~
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
npm install	#Install locally npm package for scss development
bower install	#Update foundation and dependencies
~~~

This will install all required programs(like grunt-sass) and modules(jquery, foundation).

#Usage
Just type `grunt watch` to update automatically the `style.css` file from the changes in any scss files.
